# KaTrain macOS Metal Compilation Roadmap

## Project Overview
This document outlines the complete roadmap for compiling KaTrain from scratch with full macOS Metal support.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Analysis & Documentation (Milestone: Analysis Complete)
**Goal**: Fully understand the current build system and dependencies

#### Issues to Create:
1. **[RESEARCH] Analyze current build system and dependencies** 
   - Map all Python dependencies
   - Document KataGo binary integration
   - Understand PyInstaller configuration
   - Identify platform-specific code

2. **[RESEARCH] Investigate KataGo Metal support**
   - Current Metal implementation in bundled binaries
   - Compilation requirements for KataGo with Metal
   - Performance benchmarks needed

3. **[DOCS] Create comprehensive build documentation**
   - Document all build prerequisites
   - Step-by-step compilation guide
   - Troubleshooting common issues

### Phase 2: Environment Setup (Milestone: Build Environment Ready)
**Goal**: Set up complete development and build environment

#### Issues to Create:
4. **[BUILD] Set up Python build environment**
   - Python 3.11+ with all dependencies
   - Virtual environment configuration
   - Development tools setup

5. **[BUILD] Set up C++ compilation environment for KataGo**
   - Xcode and command line tools
   - CMake configuration
   - Metal SDK verification

6. **[BUILD] Create automated build scripts**
   - Python dependency installation
   - KataGo compilation script
   - Full application build script

### Phase 3: KataGo Metal Compilation (Milestone: KataGo Metal Binary)
**Goal**: Successfully compile KataGo with Metal support

#### Issues to Create:
7. **[BUILD] Compile KataGo with Metal backend**
   - Clone and configure KataGo source
   - Set Metal compilation flags
   - Build and test binary

8. **[BUILD] Optimize KataGo Metal performance**
   - Profile Metal performance
   - Compare with bundled binary
   - Tune compilation options

9. **[BUILD] Create KataGo integration tests**
   - Verify engine communication
   - Test Metal acceleration
   - Benchmark performance

### Phase 4: Application Build (Milestone: Working Application)
**Goal**: Build complete KaTrain application

#### Issues to Create:
10. **[BUILD] Build KaTrain Python application**
    - Install all Python dependencies
    - Verify Kivy with Metal compatibility
    - Test application launch

11. **[BUILD] Integrate custom KataGo binary**
    - Replace bundled binary
    - Update paths and configuration
    - Test engine integration

12. **[BUILD] Create macOS application bundle**
    - Configure PyInstaller for Metal
    - Build .app bundle
    - Code sign application

### Phase 5: Testing & Optimization (Milestone: Production Ready)
**Goal**: Ensure stability and performance

#### Issues to Create:
13. **[TEST] Comprehensive testing suite**
    - Unit tests pass
    - Integration tests with Metal
    - UI testing on macOS

14. **[BUILD] Performance optimization**
    - Profile application performance
    - Optimize Metal usage
    - Memory usage analysis

15. **[DOCS] Create release documentation**
    - Installation guide
    - Metal requirements
    - Known issues and solutions
